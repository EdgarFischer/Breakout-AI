To get the game running, you need to install Turtle/Tkinter via the following command (on Ubuntu):

sudo apt-get install python3-tk

In this code we coded the Atari Breakout game, programmed our own reinforcment learning algorithms to learn the game,
and made them learn the game to perfection.

Hauke was mainly responsible to code the game, create the interface between the AI and the game, and create a learning algorithm
based on the exploring start algorithm.

Christoph added more efficient learning algorihtms, namely on-policy and off-policy.

Maciej did not contribute to the code, but helped create the presentation.
